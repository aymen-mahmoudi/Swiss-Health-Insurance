# Swiss-Health-Insurance
Unlike the other eurpean countires, the swiss health assurance is a bit different. The first element to consider is the *Franchise*, which is the annual amount the insured has to pay out-of-pocket for treatment, before the Swiss health insurer starts reimbursing. The *Franchise* is between 300 and CHF 2,500. (we only consider these two limits).

Once the *Franchise* has been met, your health insurer reimburses 90% of your healthcare costs. You pay the remaining 10%. In Switzerland, this 10% contribution is called the quote-part (
capped at CHF 700 per year)

Of course, if you choose the CHF 300 *Franchise*, the amount you pay monthly is higher (*Prime*).
In this simulation, we try to identify the annual medical expenses that lead to neutrality.
